## jShiny server
  jShiny Server is an alternative shiny server. It's written in [B4J](https://b4x.com/b4j.html)  
   It's similar to the official open-source shiny server.
   
### Features   
   *  Available for Windows/Linux/Mac
   *  Serve the static files to improve page load speed
   *  Support to start new R instances for each user 

### Caveat
   *  Users need to use browsers with websocket support, no fallback to long polling. Tested with latest Firefox and Chrome.
   *  All file format should be UTF-8(without BOM) unless stated otherwise
   *  The server depends on the system time(timestamp). Adjust the time before the shiny server starts, change system time during the running period may cause unexpected results.
   *  Linux file system is case-sensitive, Windows and Mac are not. Itâ€™s recommended to use lower-case file/folder names across platforms.
   *  Shiny app (folder) names should not contain special strings `b__` and `_._`, and should not start/end with spaces. Unicode characters should work, if it's supported by the OS and R programme
